In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

This App is similar to User List and User Detials.
I have used static data for Repository Object and Used filter method to show unique organization on HomePage.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

App looks like this
